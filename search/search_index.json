JoSIM is written in modern C++ and is fully customizable and extendable to offer support for improved superconducting elements as well better approximations to the Josephson effect in superconducting materials.</p> <p>A .cir file containing a SPICE syntax circuit netlist is provided as input. The circuit netlist, given appropriate input excitations can then be simulated through transient analysis. Results of this simulation can be dumped to standard output or saved in various formats such as a comma separated value (.csv) file.</p> <p>Below is a macro overview of the process performed by JoSIM.

Fortunately this can be done using a single command:</p> <pre><code>sudo yum groupinstall \"Development Tools\"\n</code></pre> <p>This will install various development tools such as gcc, make and git. JoSIM, however, requires a newer version of gcc than the one supplied within these packages.

The simplest way to do this is to install the Community version of Microsoft Visual Studio, which is free to use.

Once installed CMake can be installed much the same as any other system:</p> <pre><code>pip install cmake --user\n</code></pre> <p>To ensure that CMake detects the correct compiler (a restart might be required after MSVC install) simply run:</p> <pre><code>cmake --help\n</code></pre> <p>This should produce a help menu with a generator list at the bottom. If MSVC is installed and detected then it should have an asterisk (*) next to the relevant MSVC version to indicate that it is the default generator.</p> <p>The rest of the guide follows the same steps as Linux:</p> <pre><code>mkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build . --config Release\n</code></pre> <p>This will produce the JoSIM executable (josim-cli) and library (josim.lib) in the build/Release folder.</p> <p>Unlike Unix systems, Windows does not complete the CMake GNUInstallDirs macro correctly and if used would potentially install josim-cli in a strange location such as C:\\usr\\local\\josim\\bin\\josim-cli. It is therefore not recommended to use the install command on Windows systems but to rather copy or move the executable josim-cli to a location that is PATH obtainable under Windows.</p> <p>One way to do this is to create a folder under C:\\  called JoSIM, placing the josim-cli and josim.lib files from the build/Release directory inside and adding it to PATH environment by opening an elevated command prompt through Win+x key combination and choosing Command Prompt (Admin). Type in the following command and hit enter:</p> <pre><code>SETX PATH %PATH%;C:\\JoSIM\n</code></pre> <p>This will add the C:\\JoSIM  folder to the PATH and allow josim-cli to be located through non-elevated command prompt. </p>"},{"location":"#timeex-and-other-tools","title":"TimeEx and other tools","text":"<p>Some tools, such as TimEx, require josim-cli to be named josim. Since the josim command line executable (josim-cli) is a singular executable, this means that there are no files that rely on its specific naming for JoSIM to function correctly. It can thus safely be renamed or copies made thereof with varying names as required by external tools (such as TimEx).</p> <p>Under Unix systems a symbolic link can be established through:</p> <pre><code>sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/josim-cli /usr/local/bin/josim\n</code></pre> <p>Where the first path is the source and the second is the destination. If josim-cli is updated josim will reflect this since the symbolic link simply makes josim-cli obtainable through another name.</p> <p>On Windows it is best to simply rename josim-cli or to make a copy thereof with a new name.</p>"},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>JoSIM is governed by the MIT license, which is a very permissive license that allows anyone to redistribute the source as well as commercialize it without repercussions.

The non-zero vector only stores the non-zero elements of each component. The column indices vector stores the index where each of the non-zeros are found. The row pointer stores the total number of non-zeros after each row, starting with zero. This allows the simulation engine to quickly discern which non-zero belongs in which position if the matrix were actually a full sparse matrix.</p> <p>As example to demonstrate this we use the following 5x5 matrix:</p> \\[ \\begin{bmatrix}         1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\\\\         0 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\         0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  &amp; 0\\\\         0&amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 \\\\         0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1     \\end{bmatrix} \\] <p>Storing this matrix in system memory would take up 25 numbers.
