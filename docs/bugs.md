# Development schedule and bug reporting

JoSIM is an open-source project and thus relies heavily on feedback from the community. The development team consists at present of only a single person and therefore handling multiple tasks can sometimes be an issue. 

We request that users test the software, pushing it to its limits and reporting any bugs. Bugs will be tended to as soon as possible.

JoSIM, from v2.4, adopted a more rolling release like schedule where additional features and bug fixes will be implemented in incremental updates to mitigate large scale problems with long lasting effects.

Major releases will be made available on the releases page and features will be reported in the changelog, whereas minor releases will not be reported on.

Please report any bugs through creating a new issue on the [Issues](https://github.com/JoeyDelp/JoSIM/issues) page.
