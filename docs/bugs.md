# Development schedule and bug reporting

JoSIM is an open-source project and thus relies heavily on feedback from the community. The development team consists at present of only a single person and therefore handling multiple tasks can sometimes be an issue. 

We do, however, request from the community to be our testers and to report any bugs that might pop out from time to time. We will do our best to catch these bugs and fix any holes in the next release.

JoSIM will from this release (v2.4) adopt a more rolling release like schedule where additional features and bug fixes will be released incrementally through incremental versions to try and avoid large scale problems with long lasting side effects.

Major releases will be made available on the releases page and will be reported, whereas minor releases will not be reported.

Please report any bugs through creating a new issue on the [Issues](https://github.com/JoeyDelp/JoSIM/issues) page.
