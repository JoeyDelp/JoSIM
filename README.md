## Overview

JoSIM was developed under IARPA contract SuperTools(via the U.S. Army Research Office grant W911NF-17-1-0120).

JoSIM is a SPICE syntax circuit simulator specifically created to handle superconducting elements such as the Josephson junction. It reads in a standard SPICE deck, creates an A matrix and solves the linear algebra problem *Ax=b*. The linear algebra package KLU by [Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) is used to solve the system of equations.

A two stage distribution platform is implemented in JoSIM with the first being a command line interface (CLI) binary that is always built as standard during compilation. This is accompanied by a C++ library (*libjosim*).

JoSIM allows output of results in various formats such as comma seperated value (CSV) or raw SPICE output. JoSIM has inherent support for .PARAM commands that allow components to have variable values as well as expression parsing. JoSIM implements the RCSJ model of the Josephson junction and only supports transient analysis at present.

JoSIM takes a *.cir* file as input and produces a *.dat/.csv* file as output.

## Changelog
### v2.6.8
- Add a fix to warn of subcircuit redefenitions. Redefintions now overwrite the previous definition.
- Add a fix when parameters are used in subcircuits but defined within the global scope.

### v2.6.7
- Added ability to parameterize time points specified for `.tran` and `pwl` commands.

### v2.6.6
- Fixed a bug in noise source generation when noise step is less than or equal to the simulation step.
- Reduced aggressiveness of timestep scale down when close to transmission line step delay size. Now only scales down if TX delay is less than 1 step (previously 4)
- Added output dimensions option to josim-plot script when writing directly to PDF, SVG, EPS, etc.

### v2.6.5
- Updated the CPR specification in the JJ model to allow multiple simulataneous harmonics.
- Added a Notepad++ UDL syntax highlighting script to the scripts folder.

### v2.6.4
- Added the ability to specify CPR in the JJ model to enable non-sinusoidal CPRs needed for pi-junctions.

### v2.6.3
- Fixed a bug where Windows and CentOS parameters do not coincide. Issue was due to expression substitution.

### v2.6.2
- Fixed sp_generator.py having invalid tab spacing
- Fixed Area= and Ic= JJ parameters not producing the same result for the same critical current

### v2.6.1
- Fixed an issue with custom waveform where it wasn't reading from the file properly
- Added spline method for cubic interpolation of custom waveform
- Moved entire codebase to 64bit integers to allow larger/longer simulations
- Fixed parameters
- Fixed transmission line integer step delay rounding issue that caused an error build up

### v2.6
- Full Johnson-Nyquist temperature noise for Resistors and Resistive branch of RCSJ model
- Phi-junction model with verified Pi junction results
- Various bug fixes and code clean up

### v2.5.8
- Updated KLU to a 64-bit version capable of handling non-zero count larger than the maximum value of a 32-bit integer.
- Included SuperLU 64-bit that can be activated using the *-x 1* switch (default 0 for KLU).
- Bug fixes to pulse command.

### v2.5.7
- Fixed an issue with comparison of double values for small numbers between various compilers.

### v2.5.6
- Fixed a initial values when converting between phase and voltage when simulation output does not start at 0.

### v2.5.5
- Fixed a bug in output conversion when plotting voltage in a phase simulation and vice versa.

### v2.5.4
- Fixed comparison function for GCC interpretation of double values

### v2.5.3
- Fixed an issue with the pulse command producing incorrect pulses
- Fixed an issue where timesteps smaller than 10fs were causing out-of-range issues
- Various other bug fixes

### v2.5.2
- Fixed a major issue with relative paths not being correctly evaluated causing files to not be found even though the correct path was specified.

### v2.5.1 - 18/05/2021
- Added .spread command. See documentation for more details.
- Added .file command. See documentation for more detauls.
- Added .iv command. See documentation for more details.
- Fixed a bug where .neb value was not being read properly
