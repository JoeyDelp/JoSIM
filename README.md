## Overview

JoSIM was developed under IARPA contract SuperTools(via the U.S. Army Research Office grant W911NF-17-1-0120).

JoSIM is a SPICE syntax circuit simulator specifically created to handle superconducting elements such as the Josephson junction. It reads in a standard SPICE deck, creates an A matrix and solves the linear algebra problem *Ax=b*. The linear algebra package KLU by [Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) is used to solve the system of equations.

A two stage distribution platform is implemented in JoSIM with the first being a command line interface (CLI) binary that is always built as standard during compilation. This is accompanied by a C++ library (*libjosim*).

JoSIM allows output of results in various formats such as comma seperated value (CSV) or raw SPICE output. JoSIM has inherent support for .PARAM commands that allow components to have variable values as well as expression parsing. JoSIM implements the RCSJ model of the Josephson junction and only supports transient analysis at present.

JoSIM takes a *.cir* file as input and produces a *.dat/.csv* file as output.

## Known Issues / Bugs
### v2.4.1
- If the simulation stop time is smaller than a time at which a source has a specified value (ie. PWL), JoSIM will segfault.
- If an expression is loosely implemented anywhere in the netlist (ie. L01    1    2    1/2), JoSIM will exit with `std::invalid_argument: std::stod`.
- Precision of output files are too high, results in massive file sizes when small time steps are used.
- Specifying a component indicator such as `J` instead of `B` to indicate a junction will result in Matrix Singular error.
